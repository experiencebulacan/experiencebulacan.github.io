                        The 13 Falls is made up of a series of 13 mini waterfalls that you may traverse through an exhilarating rock formations. Some waterfalls are high and the waters are very deep, but some are shallow. You must take full care when trekking across the rocky
                        paths because there are portions that are very slippery and risky to climb. Also, you will surely get wet so bringing loads of stuff that you don't want to get wet is not advisable. Since in some areas, it is a lot easier to simply
                        swim across the waters rather than risk yourself in climbing the rocky and slippery side of the hills, or going over huge rocks blocking the way.

                            Getting to the jumpoff requires you to ride a 4×4 vehicle because of the very rough road especially towards the end. Thankfully, our friend brought a 4×4 pick-up. There were parts of the road with nothing but big rocks. Motorcycles can also go through
                            but riders have to be extremely careful especially when rainy. It took 30 mins to arrive at the jumpoff. We could only see 1 vehicle that came before us when we got there at 8 am. Upon returning thereafter the 13 falls trail,
                            there was already a sea of vehicles and motorcycles.

                            Since it was raining the previous days, the trail was really muddy when we were starting, and even muddier during our return since countless visitors have already stomped the ground. Luckily we were one of the first groups who arrived so we didn’t encounter
                            many other people on the trail except when we were returning. Social distancing was not in effect, and it seems that there was no limit on the maximum capacity.

                            Arriving at the first waterfalls, we were welcomed by a short drop of greenish-brownish water. The guide said that the second waterfall is just the one on the higher level. Technically, 13 falls is just a cascade of small waterfalls that are close to
                            each other. The two best drops are Falls #7 aka Adarna Falls and Falls #8. We mostly just passed by the smaller cascades and took our time swimming at the highlight falls #7 where we got some back massage from the falls, #8
                            where we cliff-jumped, and #13 with a larger pool. Even though the water was not clear, we still enjoyed swimming and cliff jumping. The following photos are screenshots from videos from our GoPro. For sure, the water would
                            be a lot clearer under better weather. there was already a sea of vehicles and motorcycles.

                    <div class="info">
                        <p>
                            Overall, 13 Falls in DRT Bulacan is highly recommended for adventurers who really want to take a break from being quarantined at home. We loved hiking while being excited about how the next falls would look. The water was cool and refreshing. Here are
                            my tips if you’re planning to visit, too.
                        </p>
                        <div class="guide">
                            <li>Arrive earlier than early! Because of its lack of travel requirement, DRT Bulacan receives a lot of visitors, especially on weekends. We arrived at 7:30 am and we enjoyed the falls mostly to ourselves. The crowd fluxed in after
                                us.
                            </li>
                            <li>Form a group of at least 4 people so you only pay 150/person.</li>
                            <li>Contact a guide prior to arriving. We recommend guide Johnjohn Papa (Contact number: 09353372958).</li>
                            <li>It’s better to have a 4×4 vehicle. But if not, you can hire one at 150/pax. You may contact Mark Anthony 09431337027 who rents out a 4×4 vehicle.</li>
                            <li>As much as possible, visit only when it hasn’t rained for a day so you can enjoy clear waters.</li>
                            <li>Bring a dry bag that contains drinking water, snacks, and your gadgets.</li>
                            <li>Wear proper footwear! We suggest hiking sandals with good traction. Don’t wear shoes as they will get wet 100 percent.</li>
                            <li>There’s a shower area at the jump-off where you can wash for 10php per person.</li>
                            <li>You can also have lunch at the jumpoff. There’s a store selling BBQ and rice with viands.</li>
